## Prolog Cont.

```Prolog
    reverse([],[]).
    reverse([X|L], R):- reverse(L, Rev_L), append(Rev_L, [X], R).

    revapp([], A, A).
    revapp([X|L], A, R):- revapp(L, [X|A], R).
    reverse(L,R):- revapp(L, [], R).

    ?- append(X,Y, [a,b,c]), write(X+Y), nl, fail.
        []+[a,b,c]
        [a]+[b,c]
        [a,b]+[c]
        [a,b,c]+[]
        no
    % it fail at every attempt, thus, the append will try all the possible of append.

    ?- append(X,Y, [a,b,c]), write(X+Y), nl, !, fail.
        []+[a,b,c]
        no
    % it fail at every attempt, but since we put a cut !, it would not backtrack, and only write one time.

            no

        % Note: 'not'=='\+' in prolog, but 'not' is a bad terminology.
